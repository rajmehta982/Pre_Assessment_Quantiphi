Steps to create public and private subnets in VPC
1. Create VPC
1.	Login to AWS management console and navigate to the VPC console. Select “Your VPCs” from sidebar and click on “Create VPC”
2.	Enter VPC CIDR details as belowName tag: MyVPC
IPv4 CIDR block* : 10.0.0.0/16
3.	Leave the remaining settings as it is and click “Yes, Create” button.  Note that, upon creation of “MyVPC”, it will automatically create a default “Route table” and a “Network ACL” for “MyVPC”.
2. Create Public Subnet
Make sure to select “MyVPC”  under “VPC”  drop down menu and enter 10.0.1.0/24 in “IPv4 CIDR block” for public subnet.
3. Create Private Subnet
Now create Private subnet with CIDR 10.0.2.0/24
4. Create and Attach “Internet Gateway”
1.	Create and Attach “Internet Gateway” to our newly created VPC “MyVPC”
2.	Note:  There will be a default Internet Gateway, DO NOT detach/delete it.
5. Add a route to Public Subnet
1.	In order to make the instances created in Public subnet internet accessible, we will create a new “Route table”, that will establish connection between Public subnet and Internet Gateway.
2.	Note: It is not recommended to modify “main” route table that was created by default when “MyVPC” was lanched.
3.	Create a new Route table with name “PublicRT”
4.	Select “PublicRT”, click on “Routes” tab and “edit”.

5.	Add “0.0.0.0/0” as “Destination” and click on next box, it should list the “Internet Gateway” that we created before, select it and click on “Save”


6.	Associate this “PublicRT” with Public subnet “PublicNet”

7.	Select  “PublicNet” and click “Save”
