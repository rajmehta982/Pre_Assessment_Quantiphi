Consider a text file and replace a specific word with any word of your choice:

Command:
sed -i 's/original/new/g' file.txt

Explanation:
•	sed = Stream EDitor
•	-i = in-place (i.e. save back to the original file)
•	The command string:
•	s = the substitute command
•	original = a regular expression describing the word to replace (or just the word itself)
•	new = the text to replace it with
•	g = global (i.e. replace all and not just the first occurrence)
•	file.txt = the file name
